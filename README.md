# Browser Install Tool

This is tool will be only available for Windows.

This tool was made to ship with some USB devices but can be used by anyone. Basically this tool will use scoop to install the webbrowser. This is a lightweight version of another project i'm working on. I made this lighweight version to make the compiled binary smaller
